# Exam Review

## From Office Hour

- [x] Linkedlist -> remove one element, reorder …
- [x] Copy move concept
- [x] Smart point like hw
- [x] Unorder map/set, How to write compare function for order, hash and equal to function
- [ ] STL -> might be DB conversion
- [ ] Recursive of tree
- [x] Lambda, calling function from function, functor….

## From Chen: There will be problems in the following 5 topics.

*(Some of the concepts might be combined into a single problem.)*

- [x] Linked list operations
- [x] Copy constructor, move constructor, destructor, copy assignment, move assignment, initializer_list, constructor, etc.
- [x] Smart pointers
- [x] User defined elements for map, set, unordered_set, unordered_map, hash table, etc.
- [ ] STL manipulation
   
It is likely that there will be problems in the following 3 topics.

- [ ] Recursive operations on trees
- [ ] DB conversions
- [x] Lambda and passing callables to functions.

It is possible that there will be a problem in miscellaneous topics

## Review
- [x] LinkedList; smart_pointer; assignment_construction
- [x] Callable_map_hash
- [x] STL_find_it_for_each_etc
