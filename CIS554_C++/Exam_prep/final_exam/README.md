# Exam Review

## From Office Hour

1. Linkedlist -> remove one element, reorder …
2. Copy move concept
3. Smart point like hw
4. Unorder map/set, How to write compare function for order, hash and equal to function
5. STL -> might be DB conversion
6. Recursive of tree
7. Lambda, calling function from function, functor….

## From Chen: There will be problems in the following 5 topics.

*(Some of the concepts might be combined into a single problem.)*

1. Linked list operations
2. Copy constructor, move constructor, destructor, copy assignment, move assignment, initializer_list, constructor, etc.
3. Smart pointers
4. User defined elements for map, set, unordered_set, unordered_map, hash table, etc.
5. STL manipulation
   
It is likely that there will be problems in the following 3 topics.

1. Recursive operations on trees
2. DB conversions
3. Lambda and passing callables to functions.

It is possible that there will be a problem in miscellaneous topics
