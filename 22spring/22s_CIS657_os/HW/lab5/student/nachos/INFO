## How to build NACHOS?

From the scratch (assuming it's a fresh copy)

1. Build a utility tool:

Go to `coff2noff/` and build

    $ make

This step is only required for the first time. You don't have to
re-build again unless you do a `clean` or `distclean` in `coff2noff/`.

2. Build NACHOS:

Go to `code/` and build NACHOS

        $ cd build.linux
        $ make distclean
        $ make depend
        $ make

  `make depend` is essential.

After the initial time, for incremental build, try

    $ cd code/build.linux
    $ make


However, if you think the build is behaving weirdly or you observe the
executable is not reflecting your edits in the code, it's a good idea of
clean and re-build nachos. 

    $ make distclean
    $ make depend
    $ make


## How to build NACHOS (test) programs?

The programs to be executed on NACHOS are built separately. All
programs are stored in `test/`.

**Build executables of the test programs**. Executables are created in
two stages: 

   - First, the compiler creates a .coff (regular MIPS exe) file
   - Secode, the utility tool `coff2noff` is used to convert .coff file
     to an executable for NACHOS

  *Build command*: 

    $ cd test/
    $ make


  *Clean command*: to remove `*.o` and `*.coff` files

    $ make clean

  *Dist-clean command:*  to remove all files produced by `make`
  including the executables for nachos

    $ make distclean
